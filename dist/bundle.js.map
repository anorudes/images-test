The curried function has two unusual capabilities. First, its\n     * arguments needn't be provided one at a time. If `g` is `R.curryN(3, f)`, the\n     * following are equivalent:\n     *\n     *   - `g(1)(2)(3)`\n     *   - `g(1)(2, 3)`\n     *   - `g(1, 2)(3)`\n     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n     *\n     * Secondly, the special placeholder value `R.__` may be used to specify\n     * \"gaps\", allowing partial application of any combination of arguments,\n     * regardless of their positions. If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n     * following are equivalent:\n     *\n     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.5.0\n     * @category Function\n     * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n     * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n     * @see R.curry\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n     *\n     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n     *      var g = f(3);\n     *      g(4); //=> 10\n     */\n    var curryN = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n        if (length === 1) {\n            return _curry1(fn);\n        }\n        return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n    });\n\n    /**\n     * Decrements its argument.\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.9.0\n     * @category Math\n     * @sig Number -> Number\n     * @param {Number} n\n     * @return {Number}\n     * @see R.inc\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      R.dec(42); //=> 41\n     */\n    var dec = add(-1);\n\n    /**\n     * Returns the second argument if it is not `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`\n     * otherwise the first argument is returned.\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.10.0\n     * @category Logic\n     * @sig a -> b -> a | b\n     * @param {a} val The default value.\n     * @param {b} val The value to return if it is not null or undefined\n     * @return {*} The the second value or the default value\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      var defaultTo42 = R.defaultTo(42);\n     *\n     *      defaultTo42(null);  //=> 42\n     *      defaultTo42(undefined);  //=> 42\n     *      defaultTo42('Ramda');  //=> 'Ramda'\n     *      defaultTo42(parseInt('string')); //=> 42\n     */\n    var defaultTo = _curry2(function defaultTo(d, v) {\n        return v == null || v !== v ? d : v;\n    });\n\n    /**\n     * Finds the set (i.e. no duplicates) of all elements in the first list not\n     * contained in the second list.
